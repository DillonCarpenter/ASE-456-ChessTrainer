# Sprint 2 Plan

### Goals
- PGN support
  - The user should be able to input a PGN through text or file
  - The app should be able to parse the PGN/Use Stockfish to analyze it
  - Validate input to ensure it is a valid PGN/FEN
---
- Board Visualization
  - The app should display the FEN or PGN as a board
  - The board state should be accurate and easy to read
- Motif Detection and Displaying
  - Use Stockfish to detect and label moves as mistakes, blunders, great moves, etc...
  - Use output from Stockfish to detect and display common motifs
  - Summary display (Optional)
